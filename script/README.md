## Convert webp to gif to MP4
I recently just got a 21.5" poster frame, and I uploaded lotsa of gifs regarding system/infrasture design to display.  Unfortunately the device does not provide animated gifs because it requires additional codec.

### Convert webp to gif
The original animated files are usually in webp, so I wrote a simple [process_webp.sh](./process_webp.sh) to convert `webp` to `gif`.

### Convert gif to MP4
This device is capable of playing MP4.  I converted gifs to MP4 with various parameters via this python script [convert.py](./convert.py).
